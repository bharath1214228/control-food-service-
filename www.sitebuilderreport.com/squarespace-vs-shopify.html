Squarespace is a <a href="how-to-build-an-online-store.html#1-using-a-website-builder-with-ecommerce-plans">website builder</a> that has:</p> <ol> <li>An easy-to-use <strong>drag-and-drop page editor</strong>.</li> <li> <strong>Beautiful, customizable templates</strong>.</li> <li>An all-purpose website builder that can <strong>power a variety of websites</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>The third point is especially important when comparing Squarespace to Shopify— because Shopify only powers <em>ecommerce</em> websites while Squarespace powers a <em>variety</em> of websites.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Squarespace vs Shopify: Types of websites you can make" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/20e8a6f7-66aa-424d-b058-6eabeddf618f/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Squarespace vs Shopify: Types of websites you can make</p> <p>A Squarespace website can be an online store, but it can also be a <a href="inspiration/church-websites.html">church website</a>, <a href="inspiration/portfolio-websites.html">a portfolio</a>, <a href="inspiration/blog-examples.html">a blog</a>, <a href="inspiration/wedding-websites-examples.html">a wedding website</a>, and more.</p> <h3>What Is Shopify?</h3> <p>Here’s how I’d describe Shopify:</p> <ol> <li>All about <strong>ecommerce.</strong> </li> <li>The most <strong>powerful and intuitive ecommerce</strong> platform available.</li> <li>It has a <strong>learning curve,</strong> but it’s perhaps the easiest-to-use <a href="how-to-build-an-online-store.html#2-using-an-ecommerce-website-builder">ecommerce builder</a>.</li> </ol> </body></html> </p> </div> </div> <div class="chapter chapter-with-padding" id="squarespace-vs-shopify-key-differences"> <a href="javascript:;" class="toggle">Toggle Section</a> <h2>Squarespace vs Shopify: Key Differences</h2> <div class="inner-section"> <p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Here’s the most important thing to understand:</p> <p><strong>Shopify is just for ecommerce websites, and Squarespace is for all kinds of websites.</strong></p> <p>So you can build an ecommerce website with Squarespace, but you can also build all other <a href="types-of-websites.html">types of websites</a>.</p> <p>On the other hand, you can only build an ecommerce website with Shopify (well…technically, you can make all types of websites with Shopify, too, but the platform is focused on ecommerce only).</p> <p>This leads to important differences:</p> <h3>1. Page Editor</h3> <p>Squarespace has a visual, drag-and-drop page editor. It’s very easy to use.</p> <p>You can place blocks anywhere on the page (in a predefined grid). It’s superb from a customization point of view, but it also means you have to tweak the mobile version of the website to make it perfect across all devices.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Using the Squarespace page editor." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/715b1c29-18e9-4139-b95f-1e4def511bc2/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Using the Squarespace page editor.</p> <p>Compared to Squarespace’s editor, Shopify’s WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor is uninspiring.</p> <p>Shopify’s editor is similar to Microsoft Word— it’s a rich text editor that lets you place images and videos in line with the text. Still, you might need to preview repeatedly to see how the changes look on the actual store.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Shopify's WYSIWYG editor" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/26761728-24ca-406a-a93c-548ed49888d6/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Shopify's WYSIWYG editor</p> <p>The published Shopify page adapts to the theme you use.</p> <h3>2. Templates</h3> <p>Squarespace is known for beautiful templates.</p> <p>They have over 110 beautiful, modern website templates for all types of websites (one page, ecommerce, portfolio, membership, etc.) and across 17 categories (Photography, Art &amp; Design, Local Business, etc.).</p> <p>Almost 30 of them are specifically for selling products. Besides, there are many for selling services. And you can add a store page to other themes as well, though.</p> <p>Templates are also really easy to customize — you won’t need to edit code ever to make a <a href="inspiration/squarespace-ecommerce-examples.html">beautiful Squarespace ecommerce store</a>!</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Example Squarespace template: 'Noll'." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/45f44249-d3ae-418e-bd00-e3631cd5f41a/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Example Squarespace template: 'Noll'.</p> <p>Shopify includes 9 free themes and 91 premium themes, making a total of 100 themes on <em>Shopify Themes</em>. In addition, you can also install thousands of third-party themes.</p> <p>Customizing your Shopify theme can be hit or miss. Occasionally, you’ll need to edit HTML and CSS code to make your website look like you want to.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Example Shopify theme: 'Brooklyn'." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/b35e67c2-15ba-4dbc-a670-488dfc557549/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Example Shopify theme: 'Brooklyn'.</p> <h3>3. Ecommerce</h3> <p>Squarespace is easier to use and can work well for small stores — but <strong>Shopify has much more sophisticated ecommerce features</strong>.</p> <p>In fact, Shopify is in a different class from Squarespace when it comes to ecommerce. <a href="biggest-companies-using-shopify.html">Shopify powers many large ecommerce stores</a>— including Allbirds, Kylie’s Cosmetics, and Gymshark.</p> <p>Shopify’s main competitors are heavyweight ecommerce builders like <a href="best-ecommerce-builders.html">BigCommerce, Volusion, Magento, and WooCommerce</a>. And as you can see from Google Trends, Shopify has risen to the top of this market over the last ten years:</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Over the last ten years, Shopify has risen to become the industry leader. (2022 data)" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/34073b94-16f7-4e35-90b0-fb751ad4b2ae/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Over the last ten years, Shopify has risen to become the industry leader. (2022 data)</p> <p><strong>Side Note</strong>: Google Trends data has nothing to do with the quality of website builders. It just shows what people are searching for, and they’re more interested in Shopify than other ecommerce platforms over the past few years.</p> </body></html> </p> </div> </div> <div class="chapter chapter-with-padding" id="squarespace-vs-shopify-detailed-comparison"> <a href="javascript:;" class="toggle">Toggle Section</a> <h2>Squarespace vs Shopify: Detailed Comparison</h2> <div class="inner-section"> <p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Now that you have an overview of Squarespace and Shopify and know the key differences, you might already be leaning toward one platform for making your website.</p> <p>If you’re still confused or just want to learn more about both platforms’ capabilities, read below as I dissect and compare Squarespace vs Shopify across key aspects.</p> </body></html> </p> </div> </div> <div class="chapter chapter-with-padding" id="ecommerce"> <a href="javascript:;" class="toggle">Toggle Section</a> <h2>Ecommerce</h2> <div class="inner-section"> <p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>If you are choosing between Squarespace and Shopify, you are likely wondering about <em>ecommerce</em>.</p> <h3>Squarespace Ecommerce</h3> <p>I choose Squarespace for small stores as it has more than enough ecommerce features to power a small store.</p> <p>It has subscription payments, custom notifications, taxes, shipping integrations, digital products, inventory management, rich &amp; related product display, product catalog features, point of sale (POS), etc. It also has beautiful, mobile-optimized templates for online stores.</p> <p>That said, Squarespace is not (and likely never will be) as powerful as Shopify. And that’s by design: Squarespace is for all kinds of websites, and Shopify is <em>just</em> for ecommerce websites ⁠— _a master of one in the true sens_e. So Shopify will always have more ecommerce features.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="I use Squarespace for small stores — like this one." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/f80d480f-aa6a-418f-a9e8-c7f82a36c985/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">I use Squarespace for small stores — like this one.</p> <p>To understand why, first, let’s look at Squarespace Commerce’s features:</p> <h4>Shipping</h4> <p>Squarespace allows you to add multiple different shipping options.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/db3a5940-6d77-4080-83db-c92b22dbf9cf/-/resize/1800x/"> <ul> <li> <strong>Flat Rate</strong>: Set a fixed charge for every order and every item.</li> <li> <strong>Depending on Weight</strong>: Dynamically add different shipping charges based on item weight.</li> <li> <strong>Carrier Calculated</strong>: Automatically calculate shipping charges based on FedEx, UPS, and USPS carrier charges. You must enter package dimensions and weights for each product to use this option. Also, this option is only available for shipping within the United States for Squarespace Commerce Advanced users.</li> </ul> <p>Moreover, you can manually set charges for each country/shipping zone if you do international shipping.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/9186e92f-84d4-4167-8837-0384d282875e/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>For example, here, I set different charges for the US and the Rest of the World:</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/b8df634f-6778-4c68-803e-115ef8e73359/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>There’s also a local pickup option. So you can allow customers to order online and pick up the order in person.</p> <h4>Fulfillment</h4> <p>One feature that goes right alongside shipping is fulfillment. <em>A fulfillment service company stores your products in its warehouse and then prepares and ships them for you.</em></p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: You need to use an extension for fulfillment on almost all platforms, including Shopify and Squarespace.</p> <p>If we exclude all the dropshipping extensions, <strong>Squarespace has only one fulfillment option: ShipBob</strong>. In other words, if you want to use a fulfillment service with your Squarespace store, you HAVE TO use ShipBob.</p> <p>Now, ShipBob is undoubtedly one of the <a href="https://pagefly.io/blogs/shopify/best-ecommerce-fulfillment-services-companies">top ecommerce fulfillment companies</a>, but Squarespace certainly lacks fulfillment partners.</p> <h5>Payments</h5> <p>Squarespace stores can accept payments online through Stripe and Paypal. By extension, this means your customers can pay with all major credit cards, Apple Pay, Afterpay, Paypal, and Venmo.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/66215040-2153-4b3d-9ff9-454d3e83a3ed/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>For Squarespace Point Of Sale, i.e., in-person cash and credit card payments, you can use Square hardware and system.</p> <p>I love that Squarespace doesn’t charge any transaction fee to users on any Squarespace Commerce plan. Of course, there still are credit card processing fees from Stripe and Paypal, but they are pretty standard everywhere.</p> <p>Shopify, on the other hand, charges a 0.5%-2.0% additional fee if you use a third-party payment processor—<em>more on it in the Shopify Payments section below</em>.</p> <h4>Taxes</h4> <p>You can set product prices inclusive or exclusive of tax on Squarespace stores.</p> <p>To set up sales tax:</p> <ul> <li>Squarespace offers the free TaxJar extension to stores selling in the US. TaxJar automatically calculates sales tax at checkout based on your customer’s address. [This is great because Wix, a direct Squarespace competitor, also has a similar setup (with Avalara), but it starts charging for tax calculations after a (minuscule) limit. Read more in our <a href="wix-vs-shopify.html#ecommerce">Wix vs Shopify</a> comparison].</li> <li>If you plan to sell outside the US, you can set up manual tax rates for countries, states, and provinces you ship to.</li> </ul> <p>Besides sales tax, you can also collect VAT or GST if you are on a Squarespace Commerce plan.</p> <p><strong>Side note</strong>: If you upgrade to the TaxJar Professional plan, you can automate sales tax reporting and filing too.</p> <h4>Inventory management</h4> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/2e9d8e97-622c-46f6-a8d7-d19a6f0625f1/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>Squarespace has all the basic inventory management features:</p> <ul> <li>You can add individual products, duplicate the listing, and import a CSV file to add products to your store.</li> <li>You can add SKUs and inventory quantity, and Squarespace will automatically update the quantity and keep track of the inventory when sales come in. Also, if you enable the setting, Squarespace will notify you about the low-stock products.</li> <li>You can edit stock and price directly from the inventory panel.</li> </ul> <h4>What you can sell with Squarespace:</h4> <p>Most people refer to selling physical products online when they say “ecommerce.” So, obviously, Squarespace Ecommerce has features for selling physical products - you can allow your visitors to browse your merchandise, add items to their cart, and checkout simply and efficiently.</p> <p>Besides <strong>physical products</strong>, you can also sell the following items with Squarespace:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Digital products</strong>: Sell digital content like ebooks, music, and even digital gift cards via a Squarespace store.</li> <li> <strong>Services</strong>: Squarespace’s appointment scheduling features allow you to generate leads 24/7 and sell your services.</li> <li> <strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Want to get repeat business? Sell subscription products to your loyal customers through Squarespace’s subscription platform.</li> <li> <strong>Memberships</strong>: <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/ecommerce/membership-sites">Member Areas</a> allow you to sell memberships for your virtual classes, workshops, podcasts, etc.</li> <li> <strong>Restaurant reservations</strong>: Squarespace’s collaboration with <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/tock">Tock</a> lets restaurant businesses manage reservations, events, takeout, payments, etc.</li> <li> <strong>Offline/Point of sale</strong>: In November 2019, Squarespace launched a Point of Sale system that integrates with Square’s credit card reader and Squarespace’s Commerce app. So, if you have a physical store and plan to build an online store to sell the same inventory, no worries! Squarespace’s POS syncs customer data and inventory data in real time. It’s very basic, but it gets the job done.</li> </ul> <h3>Shopify Ecommerce</h3> <p>Here is where Shopify <em>shines</em>.</p> <p>Shopify is the most <strong>powerful and intuitive</strong> <a href="best-ecommerce-builders.html">ecommerce platform</a> available.</p> <p>They have tons of innovative features that reduce the barriers to starting and scaling an online store.</p> <p>Here are two of the most important features:</p> <h4>1. The Shopify App Store</h4> <p>Ecommerce websites can have unique needs. And more business needs = more features required. For example, aside from core features, your store may need features for <em>gift wrapping upsell, inventory integrations, product reviews, cross-sell recommendations, a refer-a-friend program, shipping labels, SMS marketing, email flows, chatbot, etc</em>.</p> <p>Instead of cramming all of these features into the Shopify core, Shopify built out an app store that allows users to add features as they need them.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/e8454098-b83b-40a8-8a20-147aebc3a027/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>Shopify’s core includes what most stores need— apps are for more unusual features such as back-in-stock notifications or gift-wrapping upsells.</p> <p><strong>It’s difficult to overstate just how important the Shopify app store has become</strong>. I’ve used the Shopify app store on every Shopify website I’ve ever started.</p> <p>Shopify was also the first ecommerce website builder to launch an app store— and today, they have over 10x more apps than their competitors. This means a Shopify store can have more features and functionalities than a store made with any other ecommerce platform.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Comparing total app count between ecommerce builders with app stores (Data as of May 2022)." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/fdca0b8f-e5a5-4bba-87ec-86c757f5992b/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Comparing total app count between ecommerce builders with app stores (Data as of May 2022).</p> <p>Squarespace’s app store (called <em>Squarespace Extensions</em>) doesn’t even come close to Shopify’s.</p> <h4>2. Shopify Payments</h4> <p>Online stores require a <em>payment processor</em>. Most store builders (such as Squarespace) integrate with a 3rd party processor like Stripe or Paypal.</p> <p>In 2013, Shopify launched <em>Shopify Payments</em> - their own payment processor. For new Shopify users, it meant they could start taking payments immediately — there was no need to integrate with a 3rd party payment processor.</p> <p>Everything <em>just worked</em>. This is a perfect example of Shopify working to eliminate one more barrier to starting an online store.</p> <p><strong>Not only does Shopify Payments work flawlessly, but merchants also benefit from it.</strong> While payment processors like Stripe charge a fixed 2.9% + 0.30 USD credit card processing fee, Shopify offers as less as 2.4% + 0.30 USD on its high-tier plan and even lower rates on Shopify Plus. This may seem like a negligible difference, but as you scale, it adds up. A <a href="biggest-companies-using-shopify.html">big brand on Shopify</a> easily saves hundreds of thousands in processing fees.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Shopify also allows store owners to integrate with other third-party payment processors/providers. You can use any of the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/payment-gateways">100+ national and international online payment gateways</a> to accept your customer’s payment method of choice. Unfortunately, Shopify charges a fee of 0.5% to 2% on third-party transactions.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/0c051a0b-560d-4ea4-9565-f0d052c48709/-/resize/1800x/"> <h4>Other Ecommerce Features</h4> <p>In my experience, Shopify’s core ecommerce features are superior to Squarespace in terms of what’s included in the package and ease of use:</p> <h5>Taxes</h5> <p>Shopify uses many defaults sales tax rates and updates them regularly, eliminating a lot of setup work. Also, you can always override the default numbers if needed. Besides sales tax, you can also add “Duties and import taxes” for international orders, VAT, GST, and shipping tax.</p> <p><strong>News</strong>: Shopify recently launched its own advanced tax platform, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/tax">Shopify Tax</a>. It’s not free, but no worries - you’ll always have access to the free legacy tax features we mentioned above; choose Shopify Tax when you absolutely need it.</p> <h5>Shipping</h5> <p>You can set up general shipping rates and custom shipping rates for your store with Shopify. For local orders, you can set up pickup and local delivery. There’s also an option to enable third-party calculated rates at checkout, i.e., allow Shopify to dynamically add shipping based on charges by FedEx, USPS, UPS, Canada Post, etc.</p> <p>Moreover, Shopify has tie-ups with top logistics companies to offer you discounts on shipping rates — you can get up to 88% discount on DHL Express, UPS, or USPS.</p> <h5>Fulfillment</h5> <p>In 2019, Shopify launched its own fulfillment service called <strong>Shopify Fulfillment Network</strong> in the US. This means if you are in the US, you can let Shopify manage your end-to-end fulfillment, which includes inventory management, product storage, and delivery. We haven’t personally used it, but we found it’s more expensive than other 3PL or fulfillment services, + it lacks some fundamental features. But, no worries…</p> <p>Shopify also integrates with many more mature third-party fulfillment services like ShipBob (the only 3PL service on Squarespace), ShipHero, Red Stag Fulfillment, Shipstation, Ship Monk, etc.</p> <h5>Inventory management</h5> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/0c007c55-b287-4e66-9fc4-13eae63bd260/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>Shopify also has the basic inventory features Squarespace does, including adding inventory, updating inventory, and automatically tracking inventory.</p> <p>On top of that, Shopify has <em>Transfers</em>. Transfers help you track &amp; record incoming inventory (from suppliers to your location as well as between your store locations):</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/87be7ccb-57b9-4d91-a263-270efbc1659d/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>You can also see the history of the transfers for each inventory item.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Shopify doesn’t alert you if items run out of stock. You’ll need to install an app for it, and it adds to the business cost.</p> <h5><strong>Extra Shopify features</strong></h5> <p><strong>Besides the core features</strong>, Shopify has many more pre-built ecommerce features that Squarespace simply doesn’t have. For example, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Create staff accounts,</li> <li>Add multiple inventory locations,</li> <li>Create manual orders,</li> <li>Sell internationally: Technically, you can sell internationally with Squarespace, but Shopify has many extra important features for international commerce that Squarespace doesn’t. For example, Squarespace doesn’t let you do any multi-currency selling; Shopify does.</li> </ul> <h4>What you can sell with Shopify:</h4> <p>Like Squarespace, Shopify has features for selling other things online than just physical products. You can sell digital products, appointments (for service business), memberships, consultations, workshops and virtual classes, event tickets, gift cards, and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/12-things-to-sell-on-shopify-other-than-products">more</a>. <em>Some of these may require you to add an app, though</em></p> <p>You can even keep your offline and online sales in sync with <strong>Shopify POS</strong> - a much more powerful point-of-sale system than Squarespace POS. For comparison, unlike Squarespace, Shopify POS is omnichannel. Your customers can do local pickup, buy in-store &amp; deliver it to the online address, etc. Moreover, you can send email notifications about items they were interested in but didn’t buy in-store.</p> <div class="bubble"> <h3>Squarespace Ecommerce vs Shopify Ecommerce: Verdict</h3> <p>Squarespace is a great solution for small stores because it has all the fundamental ecommerce features + other features (as you'll discover below) needed to build a beautiful, easily-manageable store quickly.</p> <p>However, Shopify is the clear winner for making scalable stores. It has a robust platform and an extensive app store through which you can add even the tiniest ecommerce feature needed.</p> <a href="https://shopify.pxf.io/5bqddb" class="button">Try Shopify →</a> </div> </body></html> </p> </div> </div> <div class="chapter chapter-with-padding" id="templates"> <a href="javascript:;" class="toggle">Toggle Section</a> <h2>Templates</h2> <div class="inner-section"> <p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>One of the primary reasons to choose a website builder like Shopify or Squarespace is templates. Templates decrease development time drastically. When using a website builder, you don’t need to code and build your website from scratch — just choose a pre-made-by-professional template, make some changes to it, and your website is ready!</p> <p>Here’s how Squarespace templates compare to Shopify themes:</p> <h3>Squarespace Templates</h3> <p>Squarespace is known for beautiful templates. They have 110+ beautiful, modern website templates.</p> <p>I think they have the best templates of any website builder — which is subjective but not as subjective as some people think. See these examples:</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="The 'Noll' template." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/2ada0ed9-5124-4f43-a30a-971a616935a5/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">The 'Noll' template.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="The 'Beaumont' template." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/83098cef-703a-4026-bf0b-ed94dd59f3aa/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">The 'Beaumont' template.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="The 'Paloma' template." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/83091775-d811-4e30-ba3b-5d0ef6166537/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">The 'Paloma' template.</p> <h4>It’s Easy To Customize Squarespace Templates</h4> <p>It’s effortless to customize Squarespace templates. For example, to change your website colors, you just edit the <em>Color Palette:</em></p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Choosing a color palette." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/a6bfe627-c111-431d-a8b7-a24747835c95/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Choosing a color palette.</p> <p>The color palette automatically applies across your entire website.</p> <p>So what happens if you don’t like how the color is applied? Well, Squarespace lets you make those specific changes, too — if you want to:</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Don't like how color was applied? Squarespace also lets you choose specifically how colors are applied." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/17a0d71d-fd6f-44dc-8c31-c00c78981821/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Don't like how color was applied? Squarespace also lets you choose specifically how colors are applied.</p> <h4>Squarespace templates are for small stores</h4> <p>Oftentimes, a website builder’s templates correctly represent the use cases the platform is suitable for.</p> <p>If you look at Squarespace’s ecommerce templates, you’ll never feel they are for large stores: You won’t see mega menus, in-menu promotions, collections above the fold, enhanced search bar, etc. Instead, the focus will be on small catalogs (15-20 items), stories of the store/person selling the items, etc.</p> <p>In fact, most themes have “Shop” as a section. In comparison, all Shopify theme previews show just ecommerce websites.</p> <h3>Shopify Themes</h3> <p>In total, 9 free and 91 paid themes are available on Shopify’s theme store. That’s a total of 100 ecommerce-first themes! The paid themes can cost up to $350.</p> <p>Each theme is fresh, modern, and sophisticated. And each theme follows the UI best practices for ecommerce stores.</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Shopify's 'Brooklyn theme." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/3b16f0aa-c14c-4f7d-9059-9ffbf366334b/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Shopify's 'Brooklyn theme.</p> <h4>Third-Party Themes</h4> <p>There are <em>thousands</em> of Shopify themes created by 3rd party developers.</p> <p>These themes cost money and rely on the 3rd party developer to provide support but there are lots of <a href="https://sitebuilderreport.com/shopify-stores-examples">examples of live Shopify stores</a> that look beautiful.</p> <p>When it comes to 3rd party Shopify themes, there are two classes: <strong>verified</strong> providers and <strong>unverified</strong>.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Verified (90+ themes) —</strong> I already talked about these. Sold in the official Shopify theme store. All providers are vetted to ensure they provide the proper support— there’s nothing more frustrating than a theme that’s out of date in a year!</li> <li> <strong>Unverified (1400+ themes) —</strong> For sale on marketplaces like <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/shopify">Theme Forest</a>. Not verified by Shopify.</li> </ul> <h4>Theme Customization</h4> <p>Shopify includes a <em>Customizer</em> tool for customizing themes:</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="'Customizer' is Shopify's tool for theme customization." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/2c38f3f9-66d4-4b5f-89b6-75846dddf001/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">'Customizer' is Shopify's tool for theme customization.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the <em>Customizer</em> tool can be hit or miss depending on the theme.</p> <p>You can do basic things like changing the heading size between small, medium, or large or choosing how many columns you want for displaying the products.</p> <p>However, you’ll need to jump into code to make most changes. For example, the only way to change the <em>navigation text color</em> is to edit the CSS code</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="Changing the font color of your navigation may require CSS editing." src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/7b1268ee-d735-410a-a244-d121b322cbdd/-/resize/1800x/"><p class="caption">Changing the font color of your navigation may require CSS editing.</p> <p><strong>*Here’s my rule of thumb</strong>:* If you want a custom Shopify theme, you’re not going to be able to do it without jumping into CSS code occasionally or hiring a Shopify theme expert.</p> <h5>About Shopify Liquid</h5> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This section likely doesn’t concern you.</p> <p>You can fully customize your Shopify theme or build a whole new theme for your store with <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/liquid">Shopify Liquid API</a>. <em>Liquid</em> is a template language created by Shopify. All Shopify themes are built on top of it.</p> <p>Something like this is not available for Squarespace.</p> <h4>Shopify themes are for stores of all sizes</h4> <p>Shopify makes sure you know their themes are for stores of all sizes. For example, they have a filter that allows you to explore themes based on catalog size (an option like 200+ products suggest they have themes for large catalogs):</p> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/7affc4fa-b282-43c7-ac85-c6ac1056343a/-/resize/1800x/"> <p>If you preview their big catalog themes, you’ll find all the core elements required for a successful big store. Let’s look at the latest Impact theme, for example.</p> <ul> <li>It has mega menu:</li> </ul> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/6378a8b1-3f1b-44e1-bab5-ac8d9a11d172/-/resize/1800x/"> <ul> <li>It has an enhanced search bar:</li> </ul> <img class="lazyload" alt="" src="../d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0eef52ea458c41219a3cdd4589dca19afab07a93/eee20/assets/images/lqip.png" data-blink-src="https://ucarecdn.com/6c980b56-a8f8-48be-9c06-1e05f8293634/-/resize/1800x/"> <ul> <li>The focus is on collections over products on the homepage, etc.</li> </ul> <div class="bubble"> <h3>Squarespace Templates vs Shopify Themes: Verdict</h3> <p>Squarespace templates are great for small stores. They are beginner-friendly, beautiful, and very easy to customize.</p> <p>Shopify has templates for all sizes of ecommerce stores. Shopify themes are complex to customize but are way more flexible.

Squarespace's drag-and-drop editor makes changing anything a cakewalk; I can't say the same thing about Shopify.</p> <h4>What can Shopify do that Squarespace can't?</h4> <p>Shopify has more depth in its ecommerce features than Squarespace, so there's a lot Shopify can do on the ecommerce front that Squarespace can't. For example, Shopify automatically adds tax data from around the globe; Squarespace can do it only for the US, and that too will require an extension.</p> <h4>Which is better for SEO, Shopify or Squarespace?</h4> <p>Both platforms have pretty similar SEO features, but Shopify has some SEO apps that might give it an edge.</p> <h4>Which is more expensive, Shopify or Squarespace?</h4> <p>Technically, Shopify plans cost more than Squarespace plans. But from a value for money perspective, both are head-to-head for the audience they target - Squarespace is for stunning websites & small stores, whereas Shopify is for more mature ecommerce businesses.</p> </div> <div class="newsletter"> <p><strong>Get new articles in your email.</strong> Join our newsletter and be notified when we publish new articles and reviews: </p> <!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form --> <div id="mc_embed_signup"> <form action="https://sitebuilderreport.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=787a44d802ade08c3e836bf23&amp;id=a06f04c4d9" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate> <div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"> <div class="mc-field-group"> <label for="mce-EMAIL">Email <span class="asterisk">*</span> </label> <input type="email" value="" placeholder="Email Address..." name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL"> </div> <div id="mce-responses" class="clear"> <div class="response" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div> <div class="response" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div> </div> <!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups--> <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_787a44d802ade08c3e836bf23_a06f04c4d9" tabindex="-1" value=""></div> <div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button"></div> </div> </form> </div> <!--End mc_embed_signup--> </div> <div class="chapter"> <h2>Related Articles:</h2> <ul class="related-articles"> <li> <a href="blog/wordpress-vs-website-builders.html"> <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/e76311d8-e8dd-4a3c-81b1-85b39e8a619d/-/resize/800x/"> <h4>WordPress vs Website Builders </h4> <p>Should you use WordPress or a website builder to build a website?
